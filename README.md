# IntegratedLanguage

IntegratedLanguage allows you to seamlessly integrate your language learning into your everyday internet usage. You simply select the target language and the difficulty, and this extension will reinvent boring vocabulary practice by translating small bits of the web pages you visit every day. Hover over these translated bits to view the original English.

You can also connect your Quizlet account with the extension to save the foreign words you encounter. After connecting to your Quizlet account, just choose the set you want to save words to and click on a translated word in a web page to add it to your set. Included is a quick flashcard view for easy review of the words you've saved.

Hopefully with IntegratedLanguage, learning a new language's vocabulary will no longer be a chore.
