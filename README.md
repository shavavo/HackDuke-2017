# Integrated-Language

Integrated Language allows you to seamlessly integrate your language learning by translating words on the website you are viewing. By selecting the Language and difficulty, this extension will replace nouns, common phrases, and certain verbs with the language and frequency you specify. 

Integrated Language is easy to use. Simply select the language you want to learn, the difficulty (frequency of translations), hit start, and watch your page transform. To view the original English, hover over the item.
